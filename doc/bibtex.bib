  title = {A novel cloud-based trust model for pervasive computing},
  year = {2004},
  pages = { 693-700},
  month = {Sept.},
  abstract = { It is well known that trust relationships between entities are uncertain
	in pervasive computing. However, previous researchers did not attach
	enough importance to uncertainty in their trust models. Therefore,
	their models always seem arbitrary when they set some specific values
	to various trust levels. To remedy this problem, we declare that
	uncertainty should be taken into account while modeling trust. This
	paper presents such an approach, in which we model trust based on
	cloud theory, which is a promising theory to describe uncertain concepts.
	In other words, we regard trust between entities as a cloud, say
	trust cloud. Based on such a definition of trust, we further propose
	algorithms to compute propagated trust clouds and aggregated trust
	clouds, which are needed in case of trust reasoning for entities
	in pervasive computing environments. Besides, we also propose an
	approach to use our cloud-based trust model in pervasive applications,
	which is helpful to put our model into practice in trust-based security
	mechanisms.},
